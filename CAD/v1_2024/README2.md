# CAD model of HandTool

Bill of Materials:

1. 6x potmeter: type R16148-1A-2-B10K or equivalent. 10K, linear.
2. 6x ball bearing: 6700ZZ or equivalent. 15x10x4 mm.
3. Brass rods, diameter 7 mm. Lengths: 54 mm, 76 mm, 90 mm.
4. M3 threaded rod, 50 mm.
5. M3 screw (cheese head), 44 mm. (Use 50 mm, cut to length).
6. 6x M3 nuts
7. M2 screw, 16 mm (to better fix brass rods in joints)
8. M6 screws for mounting the base (flat head)

# Instructions

3D print parts as shown in assembly. Note that the JointHousing file has six distinct configurations with a total of nine printed parts.

Some printed parts can include M3 nuts.

7 mm brass rods are mostly press fitted in 3d printed parts. If the press fit becomes too loose then you can drill a 1.8 mm hole so you can fasten it with a M2 screw.

Small and large counterweights are custom made of brass in a workshop using a lathe. First balance the top part with the small counterweight, then the whole hand tool with the large counterweight.

Electric wires must be thin and flexible. Solder to potentiometer leads and apply hot glue as stress relief, or else the wires may break off at the solder joints.
